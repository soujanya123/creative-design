          <h2>Hick’s Law</h2><p>Hick's Law (for William Edmund Hick) or the Hick–Hyman Law (for Ray Hyman), predicts the time it takes to make a decision in selecting among possible choices. The Hick-Hyman Law measures cognitive information capacity. Given n equally probable choices, the average reaction time T required to choose among them is approximately.</p><br>T = b.log2(n+1)<br><p>The reaction time curve is logarithmic because for quick search we divide choices into categories, skipping half of choices at each step instead of considering each choice one-by-one. To find a given  command in a randomly ordered menu, scanning each command  is essential, requiring linear time, so Hick's law does not apply here. But if list is ordered  we can search and select by subdividing strategy that works in logarithmic time.</p><p>Hick's Law is applicable to menu design. It helps in designing menu hierarchy and depth. When we have too many choices (long hierarchy as shown in the screenshot below) we need to cognitively categorize items to reduce the time taken to select an item at any stage. The logarithmic function of Hick’s Law decides the depth of hierarchy of the menu tree.</p><h1>Application of Hick’s Law :</h1>
<p>Figure 1. below shows an  example  of a bad  web-page design which  ignores  Hick’s Law. The web-page has too many choices and  scrollbars without proper  blocking of  contents  due  to  which  user’s reaction time is extremely compromised.</p><img src="../images/theory18.jpg" /><br><p>Figure 2. below shows Google website as an example of a good web-page design. It presents few and clearly distinguished choices that obeys the Hick’s Law. Layout is simple, color choices and graphics are limited  thereby reducing  the reaction  time  to  a large  extent.</p><img src="../images/theory19.jpg" /><br><h2>Useful tips based on Hicks Law for web-page design</h2><ol>1.Distinguish links using colors.<br>2.Use consistent and familiar layouts to reduce the reaction time.<br>3.Use techniques (viz. lines, colors) to distinguish related blocks of information(that helps in selecting  alternatives quickly) to reduce overall  reaction time.</ol><br><h2>Example  of  such  webpage  is  shown  below ...</h2><img src="../images/theory20.jpg" />

	     <p><h2>Hick’s Law and the role of prior knowledge in choice</h2><p>Whether  to  use  a   more  deep  menu  with  more  initial  choices   or  to  use   a  hierarchy  of  multi-level shallow menus   is  not  only  guided  by  Hicks  Law  but  also  depends  on   user’s   prior  knowledge   and  experience  about   the  domain  and  interface.</p><p>If users generally possess sufficient prior knowledge, they can work with more initial choices, such as an alphabetized list of all choices. If users vary in their prior knowledge or the conditions that determine choice vary, then a more hierarchical  menu structure (with submenu levels) may be more efficient.</p><p>You  have to design a menu structure for ordering house-hold  items  from  a  mall  directly  to your  home through a mobile phone interface. Categorize the items in whatever  way  you  wish   into  menus  and  submenus. Design 3 alternative screens or menus for effectively ordering items from listed  categories, making use of Hicks Law. Compare your  designs by  actually  measuring  the  reaction  time  for  various  test cases  and  also using  the Hick’s  Law  expression.</p>
