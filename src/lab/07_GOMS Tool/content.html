    <strong>GOMS Model</strong>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <strong>GOMS </strong>
    <strong>(</strong>
    <strong>G</strong>oals,<strong> </strong><strong>O</strong>perators,<strong> </strong><strong>M</strong>ethods, and <strong>S</strong>election rules<strong>)</strong>    <strong> </strong>is predictive model of human information processing used for task analysis in human computer interaction design. The model was proposed
    by Stuart Card, Thomas P. Moran and Allen Newell in 1983. The model is used to analyze user’s physical , cognitive and perceptual interactions with
    computer while achieving a task or a goal in best possible way.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <strong>Goals</strong>
    are what users intend to do. <strong>Operators</strong> are actions they perform to achieve their goals. <strong>Methods</strong> are operator sequences
    that accomplish a goal. Multiple methods can exist to accomplish same goal. <strong>Selection rules</strong> describe when a user will select a method over
    the other.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    In Key Stroke Level (KLM) GOMS model the physical, cognitive and perceptual actions during a task is decomposed in form of fundamental keystroke sequence.
    The model specifies time required for each fundamental keystroke. Thus we can predict the total time of completing a task. Multiple methods can be compared
    based on the total time to complete a task in order to determine which is the most efficient method for accomplishing the task is.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    Following example of basic GOMS model is taken from <strong>John &amp; Kieras (1996b).</strong> It models the task of moving text in a word processor, in
    the context of editing a manuscript. Note the use of sub goals and selection rules, which do not exist in KLM.

    <strong>Discussion : </strong>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    Why is there a difference in the task completion time? Is it because of difference in interaction elements chosen and their layout? <strong> </strong>Is
    there a cognitive / perceptual factor contributing to task completion time?
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    An interaction task is always guided by the user goals, interface operators and alternative methods available on interface for acheiving those goals. In
    this respect the above two interfaces can be analysed using GOMS model. Task analysis using KLM-GOMS model for above interfaces can predict the task
    completion time before hand. Thus the time and cost for user-testing is reduced.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    You are therefore adviced to build a GOMS model for the above task for both interfaces and compare the predictated time with the actual time taken for the
    task.

    1. Identify a short word processing task to be accomplished using Microsoft Word. Also identify alternate methods of achieving same task in Word. Draw the
    GOMS task structure model for both methods and use KLM to predict the task completion times. Compare the two methods on the basis of task completion time.
    Now redesign the interaction and/or interface and try to reduce the task completion time by effectively utilizing KLM model.

    2. As part-B of the above assignment measure the actual time a user needs to accomplish these tasks while working on a computer screen in your lab. Do your
    measurements tally with your predictions of Part A? If no why not?
